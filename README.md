# wic_eval
Evaluation of WIC services

## Overview
Goal of this project is to create visuals, tables and text related to 
* Participation / enrollment
* Breastfeeding
* Nutrition contacts
* Weight / obesity

## Data cleaning
* Ideally, all data read-ins and cleanings should be done programatically.
* If not possible, every manual change needs to be explicitly documend.

## Miscellaneous details
* Some documents contain data for both "counties" and "agencies".  In this case, use "agencies" only.
